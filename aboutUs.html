		<h1>About us</h1>
		<article>
			<p>
	 			We are a team of college students who want to help our friends and colleagues maintain and organize their interview questions. Preparing for an interview can be both overwhelming and challenging. There are plenty of websites that offer sample interview questions such as glassdoor.com, careercup.com, and many others. However, wouldn’t it be nice if you can keep track of the questions you have already tried? Keep the code you have already implemented? Hashtags to organize question based on its type? and an easy way to retrieve those questions when you’re doing a phone interview? We want to make all of these possible and help you get the job or internship of your dream.
